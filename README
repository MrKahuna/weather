About
=====

weather is a Python program for receiving the weather forecast from the US
National Weather Service. This program only supports US-based addresses, due
to the use of the NWS weather API, which does not provide global data.

Usage
=====

weather [-v] zipcode
   Retrieves the weather for the given zipcode.
weather [-v] latitude longitude
   Retrieves the weather for the given latitude and longitude, if within the US.
weather [-v] 'location string'
   Retrieves the weather for the given text location. The text location could be
   a city name or any other location name supported by the NWS.

-v prints verbose descriptions of weather data.

Known Issues
============
 * Only US-based addresses are supported.
 * Error handling for changes in the NWS XML structure is minimal and not
   verbose.
 * If a given location string cooresponds to more than one location, the
   program will not be able to find the weather.

Possible Future Improvements
============================
 * Better error handling.
 * A disk-based cache of coordinates for locations, instead of hard-coded
   zipcodes.
 * A better system for resolving location strings to coordinates.
